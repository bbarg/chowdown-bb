# Welcome

I'm starting a project to catalogue family recipes from my mom after her death, to help me
process grief and also honor her desire to teach me to cook.

Expect this to be incrementally updated with more recipes and photos as I have
time. Eventually I hope to create a physical book with copies of the recipe from this site!
