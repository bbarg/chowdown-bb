tags: vegetarian, corn, dairy

ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons safflower or vegetable oil
- 8 large ears of corn, shucked
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour

directions:
- Preheat oven to 425 degrees. When the oven is hot, pour the oil into a 9-inch cast-iron
  skillet and tilt the pan so that the oil coats the sides and bottom. Place the skillet in
  the oven for 30 minutes.
- Meanwhile, cut the kernels from the cobs and place in a large bowl. Using the sharp edge
  of a wide, heavy knife, scrape the cobs thoroughly so that the pulp and juice run into the
  bown. (You should have about 7 cups.) Add the salt, cream and flour, and mix well.
- Pour the sticky corn mixture into the scorching hot skillet, and press down with a
  spatula to flatten and compact it. Bake until the edges begin to brown and the top is
  browned in places, about 40 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and allow to site for 5 to 10 minutes. Run a knife along the inside
  edge of the skillet to loosen the corn. Place a serving platter on top of the pan,
  carefully invert platter and pan, and lift off the pan. If the stars align, you will have
  a beautiful golden brown corn cake, but it might take a few tries before you perfect
  this. If the mixture sticks to the pan, don't worry! Just scrape it all into a bowl and
  mix lightly to disperse the crispy bits. It will still be delicious.

From the New York Times:

> Serves 8. Inspired by a recipe by [Lee

From Ben: 

> I'm pretty sure this one is from the New York Times magazine. I remember my mom
> making this on summer evenings, and the rich yellow-brown color of the carmelized
> corn. I've tried to replicate this recipe from memory for several years (I never
> read the original recipe), and it's never been quite the same (because I forgot
> that this sits in the oven, and that the skillet needs to be scorching before you
> add the corn). Now I'm excited to try it again!
