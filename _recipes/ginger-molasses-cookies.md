- In a bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and

- In an electric mixer, cream the butter and the granulated and brown sugars on medium
  speed for 1 minute, or until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a
  rubber spatula.

> This recipe comes from one of my mom's favorite baking cookbooks: [Rosie's All-Butter,
> Cream-Filled, Sugar-Packed Baking
> Book](https://rosiesbakery.com/rosies-bakery-cookbook/). I think the title well
> expresses her cooking philosophy: never compromise taste and don't make substitutions.

> We would make these every christmas and fill huge cookie tins. Plastic bags of these

> not at all uncommon for me to eat 10 or more in one day!
