This recipe comes from Annie Kelly, a close friend of my mom's from
back when they were camp counselors together at Camp Algonquin in
northern Michigan. Emma is Annie's daughter, and Betsy and Jamie are
Wendy's two sisters.

From Annie:

> It was on a 3x5 card (my handwriting on the front & either Betsy's
> or Wendy's on the back side; maybe it originally came from Jamie!).
> Pretty sure they made it while you were living in [Ann Arbor] (we
> were visiting from [Suttons Bay] & Betsy may have been in town from
> New England). Betsy was helping Emma write/draw some of her favorite
> things.
