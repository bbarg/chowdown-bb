title: "Keeps-Getting-Better Lentil and Kale Salad"
tags: vegetarian, dairy, bonappetit

ingredients:
- 1 large bunch Tuscan kale (about 10 oz.)
- Kosher salt
- ½ cup raw almonds
- 3 scallions
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 lemon
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1½ cups black beluga or French green lentils
- 1 Tbsp. cumin seeds
- ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- 5 oz. feta
- 1 cup Castelvetrano olives

directions:
- Strip leaves off stems from 1 large bunch Tuscan kale; discard stems or save for later! Stack
  leaves, then roll into fat cigars. Slice crosswise into ¼" strips to long, thin ribbons. Unfurl
  ribbons and run your knife through them just once or twice more to shorten any very long
  strips. Transfer to a large bowl, season with salt, and massage until kale is silkier, softer, and
  darker in color, 1–2 minutes.
- Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over high heat. While you're waiting, prep the
  spiced oil. Coarsely chop ½ cup raw almonds; set aside. Trim 3 scallions and separate white and
  green parts (save the green parts for later in the recipe); thinly slice white parts and transfer to
  a small skillet. Smash and peel 4 garlic cloves. Add those to same skillet, too. Using a vegetable
  peeler or paring knife, remove three 3" strips of lemon peel (avoiding white pith); reserve rest of
  the lemon for your salad dressing. Add peels to skillet. Pour ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil into
  skillet and stir so that all of the elements are coated in oil.
- Add 1½ cups black beluga or French green lentils to now-boiling water, reduce heat to medium, and
  simmer, uncovered, until lentils are tender but still al dente, 20–25 minutes (they'll turn mushy if
  overcooked). We love to cook lentils like pasta—that is, in an abundant amount of salted water—so
  that we can monitor their doneness as they cook and make sure they don't get too soft.
- While lentils cook, heat skillet with scallion mixture over medium. Cook, stirring occasionally,
  until garlic starts to brown and lemon peel starts to curl, about 3 minutes. Add almonds and cook,
  stirring frequently, until almonds are browned, about 3 more minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1
  Tbsp. cumin seeds and ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes—the residual heat from the oil will bloom
  those spices and bring out their flavors.
- Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, shaking to help oil drain; reserve oil
  (that's the base of your salad dressing). Spread almond mixture (don't forget those cumin seeds!) on
  a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Season with salt and let cool (the nuts will get
  crunchier as they sit).
- Crumble 5 oz. feta into bowl with kale. Smash 1 cup Castelvetrano olives with the back of your
  knife; remove pits. Tear olives into large pieces and add to bowl. Thinly slice reserved scallion
  greens and add most to bowl (save some for serving). Add juice of reserved lemon and ½ tsp. salt.
- Drain lentils well, shaking to get rid of excess moisture, and add to bowl with kale; season with
  salt. Add infused oil and half of nuts and toss to combine.
- Divide salad among bowls. Garnish with remaining nuts and scallion greens. (If you’re taking this
  to work, just throw all of the scallions and nuts in at once—or bring them to work in separate
  containers and be that person garnishing your desk salad. You're worth it.) Eat around the lemon
  peels and garlic slices, which are edible but intense.
