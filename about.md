My mother Wendy Baker was [hit by a car and killed on July 12,
2022](https://obituaries.yakimaherald.com/obituary/wendy-baker-1085469065). She [left a
lot of legacies in this
world](https://obituaries.yakimaherald.com/obituary/wendy-baker-1085469065), but the most
important to me was her love for cooking and her voluminous recipe collection. This site
is a tribute to my mom's culinary passions, and the love that was shared with each dish
and shared cooking experience
